It uses the principles of Lean, an efficiency methodology that was initially developed for manufacturing. Lean integration is a hands-on management system that guides day-to-day decision-making, as well as a long-term strategy. In the context of data projects, the “customer” can be anyone who benefits from the end result of the project, whether that’s an internal user, a project sponsor, or an external customer that will interact directly with the system. In all instances, lean integration follows seven principles:\r\n1) Eliminate Waste, \r\n2) Automate Processes, \r\n3) Empower the Team, \r\n4) Continuously Improve, \r\n5) Build Quality In, \r\n6) Plan for Change, and \r\n7) Deliver Value to the Customer. \r\nLean integration is a data-driven methodology that relies on continuous improvement and elimination of waste to maximize customer value."},{"id":"976abf6a-1bda-4bb0-b7d7-295fa76a4669","TopicID":4,"TopicName":"Data-Driven Innovation","Description":"Data-Driven Innovation is the use of data and analytics to develop or foster new products, processes, organizational methods, and markets. It is a formal innovation process paradigm that focuses on creating value through the use of data and analytics. Data-driven innovation is often confused with several other data-related phenomena, but it is formally defined as a process-based taxonomy of different data-driven innovation approaches. The future of innovation processes is anticipated to be more data-driven and empowered by the ubiquitous digitalization, increasing data accessibility, and rapid advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computing technologies. Data-driven innovation can drive both the discovery and execution of innovation, achieving new business models, products, and services with a confirmed business value."}],"questions":[{"id":"fbb26544-9d66-4dae-94ad-817f15761398","Question":"Where did Lean originate, and which manufacturing principles influenced its development?\r\nA: The primary focus of Lean
